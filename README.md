# SkinGuardian
 A web application designed to predict and classify the type of skin cancer using dermatoscopic images uploaded by users.

## 1. Project description
### Context and goals
Skin disease poses a major global health challenge, affecting a vast number of people. It often proves difficult for individuals to visually recognize the signs of skin conditions. Early detection and treatment are critical, as they substantially lower the risk of morbidity and mortality related to these diseases.

**SkinGuardian** is a web application that utilizes **convolutional neural networks** to accurately classify skin diseases. This deep learning model is trained using the HAM10000 dataset, which includes 10,015 dermatoscopic images covering a variety of diagnostic categories. This application enables users to upload images of their skin for analysis, providing reliable disease identification and aiding users in understanding their skin health and promoting timely medical consultations and interventions.
